# CYD Framework

A PlatformIO foundation for projects built on the ESP32 Cheap Yellow Display
(CYD, ESP32-2432S028R). It provides the display, touch, navigation, sound,
WiFi connection, and clock building blocks so a project can add
its own screens and behavior without rebuilding the device layer.

## Included framework features

- **Display and navigation:** shared CYD initialization, theme, title bar,
  navigation buttons, touch mapping, and button hit-testing.
- **WiFi connection:** loads configured networks from `credentials.h`, scans
  for them during connection/retry, and connects to the strongest known
  network. WiFi status is available on the status screen.
- **Clock:** NTP synchronization at startup and on demand, local time zone
  configuration, title-bar clock, and time/date formatting helpers.
- **Touch calibration:** a four-target calibration screen accessible from
  Tools; successful raw touch limits are saved in ESP32 non-volatile storage.
- **Sound:** non-blocking built-in tones and tone sequences for the speaker
  amplifier.
- **Example screens:** Home, WiFi Status, System, and Tools demonstrate
  how to compose screens with the shared navigation layout.

The WiFi connection code scans for configured access points internally. There
is no separate nearby-network scanner page.

## Project layout

```text

  cyd.h                 CYD helper umbrella header
  cyd_pins.h            Board pin and touch calibration definitions
  cyd_theme.h           Colors, fonts, dimensions, and navigation layout
  cyd_display.h         Display, title bar, clock, and button helpers

  cyd_time.h            NTP synchronization and time/date helpers
  cyd_helpers.h         LED, backlight, light sensor, and uptime helpers
  credentials*.h        WiFi/NTP settings template and local configuration

  main.cpp              Startup, WiFi connect/maintain, screen table, touch loop
  cyd_globals.cpp       Shared display and touch objects

  screens/              Example screens
```

`main.cpp` routes each `Screen` enum value through a screen table. To add a
screen, define its draw, enter, and touch-handler functions, add its interface
to `include/app.h`, then add a matching entry to the table. Shared device
features are exposed through the CYD and sound helper headers.

## Setup

1. Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).
2. Copy `include/credentials_template.h` to `include/credentials.h` (the
   configuration file is gitignored) and set:
   - One or more WiFi SSID/password pairs in `wifiNetworks`.
   - `NTP_SERVER_1` and `NTP_SERVER_2`.
   - `TZ_STRING` to a POSIX time zone, such as `CST6CDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0`.
3. Build and upload with `pio run -t upload`; open the serial monitor at
   115200 baud.

Library and platform versions are pinned in `platformio.ini`.

## Example navigation

| Screen | Button 1 | Button 2 | Button 3 | Button 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Home | — | — | — | System |
| WiFi Status | Refresh | — | — | Home |
| System | Back | Tools | Refresh | Home |
| Tools | Back | NTP | Cali TS | Home |

Buttons keep a consistent position across screens. Button 4 returns Home on
all screens except Home, where it opens System. The System screen also has
WiFi shortcut button in its upper-right corner. Tools has a Ping
button at the upper right and opens touchscreen calibration with **Cali TS**.
